			If you specify the 'font-family' or 'color' properties on the <body> element, they will apply to most child elements. This is because the value of the 'font-family' property is "INHERITED" by child elements. It saves you from having to apply these properties to as many elements (and results in simpler style sheets).
			You can compare this with the 'background-color' or 'border' properties; they are "NOT INHERITED" by child elements. If these were inherited by all child elements then the page could look quite messy.

			You can force a lot of properties to inherit parents elements by using 'inherit' for the value of the properties. In the below example, the <div> element with a class called 'page' inherits the padding size from the CSS rule that applies to the <body> element.
