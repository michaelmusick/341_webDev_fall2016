        <p>
            Images should typically be stored in a sub-directory called 'images/'. This is considered "good practice" for managing images.
            <br />
            If the site will be quite large with many images, you may wish to use sub-directories, within the images directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add an image, we use the &ltimg /&gt <!-- <img /> --> tag. <br />
            This is an empty element, again meaning there is no closing tag.
            <br />
            The &ltimg /&gt <!-- <img /> --> tag must contain at least the following two attributes.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "src" - This tells the browser where to find the image. This will typically be a relative URL pointing to your images directory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "alt" - This provides a text description of the image, which describes the image if you can not see it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Optionally:
            <ul>
                <li>you can include the "title" attribute. This attribute will pop up as a tooltip in most browsers.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
