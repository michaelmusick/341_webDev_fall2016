		/*
		In the last chapter, you saw how the float property can be used to move an element to the left or the right of its containing block, allowing text to flow around it.

		Rather than using the <img> element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:

		1: The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image (such as the small class in our example).

		2: New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

		In this example you can see the align-left and align-right

		classes used to align the image.

		It is also common to add a margin to the image to ensure that the text does not touch their edges.

		<p><img src="images/magnolia-medium.jpg" alt="Magnolia" class="align-left medium" /><b><i>Magnolia</i></b> is a large genus that contains over 200 flowering plant species. It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol and, having evolved before bees appeared, the flowers were developed to encourage pollination by beetle.</p>
		<p><img src="images/magnolia-medium.jpg" alt="Magnolia" class="align-right medium" />Some magnolias, such as <i>Magnolia stellata</i> and <i>Magnolia soulangeana</i>, flower quite early in the spring before the leaves open. Others flower in late spring or early summer, such as <i>Magnolia grandiflora</i>.</p>
