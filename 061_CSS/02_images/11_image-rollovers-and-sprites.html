			Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it.

			This is achieved by setting a background image for the link or button that has three different styles of the same button (but only allows enough space to show one of them at a time). You can see the image we are using in this example on the right. It actually features two buttons on the one image.

			When the user moves their mouse over the element, or clicks on it, the position of the background image is moved to show the relevant image.

			When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a sprite. You can add the logo and other interface elements, as well as buttons to the image.

			The advantage of using sprites is that the web browser only needs to request one image rather than many images, which can make the web page load faster.

			In this example, you can see two links that look like buttons. Each of the buttons has three different states. These are all represented in a single image.

			Because the <a> element is an inline element, we set the display property of these links to indicate that they should be inline-block elements. This allows us to specify the width and height of each <a> element so that it matches the size of its corresponding button.

			The background-position property is used to move the image in order to show the button in the right state.

			When the user hovers over a link, the :hover pseudo-class has a rule that moves the background-position of the image to show a different state for that button.

			Similarly, when the user clicks on the link, the :active pseudo- class has a rule to show the third state for that button.

			Touch screen devices will not change a link's state when the user hovers over it, as the screens do not yet have a way to tell when the user is hovering. However, they will change their appearance when the user activates them.
