		<title>Multiple Style Sheets - Link</title>
		<!--
		On this page you can see the other technique for including multiple style sheets. Inside the <head> element is a separate <link> element for each style sheet.

		The contents of site.css are identical to styles.css on the left hand page, except the code does not contain @import rules.

		As with all style sheets, if two rules apply to the same element then rules that appear later in a document will take precedence over previous rules.

		Result

		In the example on this page, any rules in typography.css would take precedence over rules in site.css (because the typography rules are included after the other rules).

		In the example on the previous page, the rules in styles.css would take precedence over the rules in typography.css. This is because when the @import rule is used, that is the point at which the browser considers the rules live.
