		<title>Multiple Style Sheets - Import</title>
		<!--
		Some web page authors split up their CSS style rules into separate style sheets. For example, they might use one style sheet to control the layout and another to control fonts, colors and so on.

		Some authors take an even more modular approach to stylesheets, creating separate stylesheets to control typography, layout, forms, tables, even different styles for each sub-section of a site.

		There are two ways to add multiple style sheets to a page:
			1: Your HTML page can link to one style sheet and that stylesheet can use the @import rule to import other style sheets.
			2: In the HTML you can use a separate <link> element for each style sheet.

		The example on this page uses one <link> element in the HTML to link to a style sheet called styles.css. This stylesheet then uses the @import rule to import the typography.css and tables.css files.

		NOTE: If a styesheet uses the @import rule, it should appear before the other rules.
