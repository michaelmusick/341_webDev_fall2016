			By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a block- level element using the display property with a value of block.

			Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:

			1: On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.

			2: On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

			You can specify class names that allow any element to be centered, in the same way that you can for the dimensions or alignment of images.

			The techniques for specifying image size and alignment of images can also be used with the HTML5 <figure> element
