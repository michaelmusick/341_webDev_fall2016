Therefore, even with HTML5 you need to provide your video in moultiple formats.				H264: IE and Safari				WebM: Android, Chrome, Firefox, Opera		We use the <source /> element inside the video element to specify the video source. This would be used inplace of the src attribute in the video element.		You can use multiple source elements, which specifies to the browser the video is available in multiple formates. (Due to a bug on the iPad, you should provide the MP4 video as the first format.)		Within the source element, the src attribute specifies the URL.		type - You should use this attribute to tell the browser what format the video is in. Otherwise, it will downlaod some of the video to see if it can play the file. (This takes time and bandwidth!!!)			codecs - The codec that was used to encode the video is supplied within the type attribute. NOTE: The use of single quotes, as well as double quotes in the type attrubute when it is supplied.		If the browser does not support the video element of the format of video used, it will display whatever is between the opening and closing video tags. 		-->		<video poster="images/puppy.jpg" width="400" height="320" preload controls loop>			<source src="video/puppy.mp4" type='video/mp4;codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"' />			<source src="video/puppy.webm" type='video/webm;codecs="vp8, vorbis"' />			<p>A video of a puppy playing in the snow</p>		</video>	</body></html>
