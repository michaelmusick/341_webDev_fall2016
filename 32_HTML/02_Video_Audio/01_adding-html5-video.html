<!DOCTYPE html><html>	<head>		<title>Adding HTML5 Video</title>	</head>	<body>		<!--			HTML5 introduced two new elements to natively handle the presentation of video and audio, these are respectively the `video` and `audio` elements. You do need to becareful, as older browsers will not support these elements and the presentation of the associated media. For that reason, it is sometimes still preferable and encouraged for you to host your media on sites such as YouTube, Vimeo or Soundcloud.			The advantage of using a hosted media provider, is that you can upload a high quality version of your media and these sites will handle compatability, encoding, and the other details neccessary for the media to play on a variety of browsers. Additionally, web hosting companies often charge extra if you use a lot of bandwidth, and due to the size of most movie files, this can occur easily.			If the content needs to be exclusive to your site, and not available through a thrid-party site such as YouTube, then you must host the file. Also, some services will limit the number of 'plays' that you can have for a certain period of time. So you will need to be aware of that.			NOTE: You should technicall use both flash and HTML5 video element when self-hosting. However, it is my opinion thet flash is dead, so we will focus solely on HTML5.		-->		<video src="video/puppy.mp4"			poster="images/puppy.jpg"			width="400" height="300"			preload			controls			loop>			<p>A video of a puppy playing in the snow</p>		</video>		<!--			Video Attributes				src - the url for the video				poster - The attribute allows you to specify an image to show while the video is downloading or until the user tells the video to play.				In HTML5 you do not need to supply values for all attributes in the video element. These attributes are like 'on/off' switches. If they are present then it is turned on, if absent off.					preload - This tells the browser what to do when the page loads. It can have one of three values:						none (default) - The broswer should not load the video until the user presses play.						auto - The browser should download the video when the page loads.						metadata - The browser should just collect information such as the size, first frame, track list, and duration.					width, height - These attributes specify the size of the player in pixels.					controls - When used this idicates the browser should supply its own controls for playback.					autoplay - When used, this attribute specifies that the file should play automatically.					loop - This tells the browser whether or not to loop the video.				-->	</body></html>
